\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame of tibble, can be aggregated or raw}

\item{measure}{Numeric measure for function to create calculations with,
if NULL then it will take the first numeric field available}

\item{dimensions}{Vector of dimensions for analysis, by default all character
or factor variable will be used}

\item{coverage}{Portion of variability to be covered by narrative, 0 to 1}

\item{coverage_limit}{Maximum number of elements to be narrated, overrides
coverage to avoid extremely verbose narrative creation}

\item{narrative_total}{glue template for total volumes narrative}

\item{narrative_outlier}{glue template for single outlier narrative}

\item{narrative_outlier_multiple}{glue template for multiple outliers narrative}

\item{return_data}{return a list of variables used in the function's templates}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to glue::glue}
